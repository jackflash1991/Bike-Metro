# OSM Trails to LOOM Transit Map Pipeline

This document provides an overview of the pipeline for converting OpenStreetMap (OSM) trails into the LOOM transit map format.

## Overview
The LOOM transit map pipeline is designed to facilitate the integration of OSM trail data, allowing for improved visualization and accessibility of transit routes crossed by these trails. This enables better planning and reporting for outdoor activities.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract OSM trail data relevant to the area of interest.
2. **Data Transformation**: Convert the extracted data into a format suitable for LOOM.
3. **Integration**: Combine the transformed data with existing transit map data.
4. **Validation**: Ensure the data accuracy and completeness.

## Usage
Follow the instructions to run the pipeline effectively and contribute to the continuous improvement of the transit map.

These updates aim to enhance user experience and provide rich information for outdoor enthusiasts.
